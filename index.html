  <h1>Piano Blend</h1>

    This website was created by Garrett Udstrand (<a href="mailto:udstr013@umn.edu">udstr013@umn.edu</a>),
    Tyler Heim(<a href="mailto:heim0155@umn.edu">heim0155@umn.edu</a>), and Pranav Pokhrel (<a
      href="mailto:pokhr013@umn.edu">pokhr013@umn.edu</a>).
    It is our website submission for the final project in CSCI 5611. We made a realistic piano animation called "Piano
    Blend". An brief summary of our project
    can be seen below

  <h1>Project Files</h1>
  <p>
    This animation was created using <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>. Inspiration was taken for
    the modelling of the piano from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ge1TYv6vssc">this video</a>, but the
    decrepit, older look of the piano was replaced with a more modern look. The wood was replaced for a black,
    laquered wood, the amount of scratches, dust, and general wear and tear in the materials was toned down,
    and the model was changed to have a simplified, more narrow, and more modern design. Inspiration for creating
    the hand was taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpokgpH1VvE">this video</a>, but the hand was
    changed from having a more Pixar-like, cartoon-y design to a quasi-realtic one
